# OreNetServer Start Script (PowerShell)

This PowerShell script loads environment variables from a `.env` file and starts the OreNetServer for mining Ore (ORE) on the Solana blockchain. It offers options to run in **Priority-fee mode** or **Dynamic-fee mode** and ensures that the server is automatically restarted in case of failure.

## How it works:

1. **.env File Loading**: The script reads a `.env` file and sets environment variables to configure the server.
2. **Server Mode Selection**: Choose between two modes:
   - **Priority-fee mode**: Sets fixed transaction fees.
   - **Dynamic-fee mode**: Calculates dynamic transaction fees based on real-time data.
3. **Error Loop**: If the server fails to start, the command will be retried in a loop.

### Configuration:

- Adjust the path to the `.env` file and the server executable before running the script.
- The `.env` file should contain variables like `RPC_URL`, `WALLET_PATH`, `DYNAMIC_FEE_URL`, etc.

### Execution:

```powershell
.\start-server.ps1
